<h4>Frenectomy</h4>
<p></p>
<p>There are fibers which runs from under the lips to the gum area. These fibers are called frenum.
</p>
<p>In some situations, this frenum attachment is close to the gum margin which results in recession of gums, or gaps between the teeth. With minor correction of frenum the health of the gums can be preserved. This procedure is known as Frenectomy.
</p>
<p>We use technique in which there is primary closure of the gums  by which the healing is faster with minimal or no scaring.
