<h4>Periodontitis</h4>
<p></p>

<p>About 20 to 30% of the General population suffers from Chronic Periodontitis. It begins with Gingivitis- inflammation of gums. Our body responds to the presence of bacteria with immune reaction and some times because of low immunity or hyper immunity the infection leads to loss of supporting tissues of teeth- Periodontal ligament, bone.
</p>
<p>If untreated, Periodontitis can lead to bleeding gums, receding gums, swelling,  pus, foul odour, looseness of teeth.  Periodontitis is one of the major cause of teeth loss.
</p>
<p>Recent research has shown that Periodontitis may be one of the risk factor for heart disease, and many other conditions like prematured Birth and low weight of infants if present during pregnancy. It is also linked with Alzheimer.

<h5>Diagnosis</h5>
<p>It is important to perform a comprehensive periodontal exam which involves probing of the gums of each and every tooth, determine the loss of attachment, mobility and perform a radiographic assessment to arrive at the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. It also involves checking local factors, medical history, smoking habits etc. Periodontal disease can be chronic or aggressive in nature. Aggressive Peridontitis loses the bone and tissue very rapidly and therefore correct diagnosis is very important.

<h5>Treatment</h5>
<p>Depending upon the state of the disease and the amount of bone loss it can be treated either non surgically or surgically. The non surgical treatment is very effective in keeping the disease under control.

<p>Non surgical treatment involves:
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Good oral hygiene instructions</li>
<li>Personal brushing, flossing and interdental brushing</li>
<li>Root planning</li>
<li>Antimicrobial application</li>
<li>3 to 4 months maintenance- professional cleaning which may be deep cleaning</li></ul></p>

<h5>Surgical Treatment</h5>
<p>In moderate to advanced cases surgical treatment may be required which involves:
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Pocket reduction treatment</li>
<li>Guided tissue regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p>One of the most important challenges faced traditionally was the recession of gums as a result of surgical and non surgical treatment. Many micro techniques and bio engineered materials have been developed in conjunction with the guided tissue regeneration which minimizes these side effects. It becomes particularly important when dealing with the disease in the front part of the mouth.
</p>
<p>At Valley Periodontics and Dental Implants, we take pride in using state of the art techniques such as clinical microscope to minimize esthetic side effects. Our aim is to preserve the tissue which has been given to us by nature and at the same time eliminate the disease.
