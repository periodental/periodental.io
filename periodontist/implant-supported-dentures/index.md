<p>Conventional dentures have a tendency to come loose because of the ineffectiveness of dental adhesives—but with implant supported dentures, that ceases to be a problem.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of stabilising dentures with dental implants are:</p>

<p>
<ul><li> Improved speech and confidence                           </li>
<li>     It’s a minimally invasive procedure</li>
<li>     Ends the cost and inconvenience of denture adhesives</li>
<li>     Restores proper chewing. This allows for a better diet and improved health</li>
<li>     Helps stimulate your jaw and maintain bone structure</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_to_expect">What to expect</span></h3>
<p>During your initial consultation an x-ray will be taken and a mould of your teeth created to observe the implant position. If you do not have adequate jaw bone structure you may require a bone graft prior to surgery.
</p><p>After this we will then advise the best form of treatment (either fixed, removable or implant-stabilised) and the best way to proceed with this treatment.
Different types of implant supported overdentures
</p><p>There are three different treatment options with implant supported dentures:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fixed">Fixed</span></h3>
<p>If  all of your teeth require replacement, a custom made denture can be fitted to dental implant foundations. Once the implants are inserted and have healed, you will be fitted for an overdenture that attaches to the implants. Due to the fact that the overdenture is supported by dental implants it can help stimulate the jaw and  maintain bone mass.
</p><p>Fixed dentures can be removed by a dentist for  professional cleaning and maintenance.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Removable">Removable</span></h3>
<p>A removable implant-supported overdenture is created in a similar fashion to a fixed implant-supported overdenture. However,  once the dental implants are placed in your jaw, a custom-made bar will be attached to the implants to support the new overdenture.
</p><p>Your new overdenture will be able to snap or clip into place, and you will be able to remove it for cleaning yourself.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Implant-stabilised">Implant-stabilised</span></h3>
<p>Implant-stabilised overdentures are custom created in the same manner as fixed and removable dentures. However, a smaller number of implants are used to stabilise the denture. This type of denture is able to be taken out each night to clean it.
