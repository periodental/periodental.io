<p>Dental Implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel and function like natural teeth. The implants are tiny titanium posts which are placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. The bone bonds with the titanium creating a strong foundation for artificial teeth. In addition, dental implants can help preserve facial structure, preventing the bone deterioration which occurs when teeth are missing.
</p><p>A crown or a bridge is placed over the implant(s). The way our natural teeth have roots, dental implants are similar in many ways to natural teeth. The implants act like the roots of teeth and provide support to the crown.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preserve_bone_shrinkage">Preserve bone shrinkage</span></h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of placing a dental implant is that it preserves our bone from shrinking to a significant extent. Bone underneath the denture or a conventional bridge has no function and as a result it reduces in size. Over the time, the denture becomes loose or the tissue underneath the bridge collapse and leads to esthetic and functional problems. The rate of this bone loss is reduced dramatically with implants.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prevent_damage_to_adjacent_natural_teeth">Prevent damage to adjacent natural teeth</span></h3>
<p>Conventional bridges takes support of adjacent natural teeth and in order to make a bridge the adjacent teeth needs to cut substantially. This may lead to sensitivity. Studies have shown that a significant number of cut teeth undergo necrosis over the time which may necessitate root canal treatment.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fixed_teeth">Fixed teeth</span></h3>
<p>There are many instances where a conventional fix bridge may not be an option especially when molars are missing at the back. Only option in conventional treatment then would be to have removable partial dentures.  Dental implants are ideal in those situations as one can have a fixed teeth.
