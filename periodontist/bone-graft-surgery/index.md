<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bone_Graft">Bone Graft</span></h2>
<p>In some situations where the tooth has been lost for a long time, the bone width and height is deficient. In these situations a bone graft is performed.
</p>

<p>Usually Bone graft is performed with collagen membrane and particulate bone materials derived from human or animals. However in some situation depending upon the complexity of case following techniques are utilized:
</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Tenting_Screws">Tenting Screws</span></h5>
<p>Tenting screws are utilized to provide extra support to collagen membrane and hence it prevents the collapse of the membrane. This way one can achieve greater and more predictable regeneration of bone height which is hard to achieve.

</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Titanium_meshed_membrane">Titanium meshed membrane</span></h5>
<p>Because Titanium meshed membrane has a memory it stays in desired shape and hence one can achieve predictable regeneration in desired directions.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Tacking_screws">Tacking screws</span></h5>
<p>Tacking screws prevents micro movement of collagen membrane and hence the regeneration can be achieved with out any complications like exposure of the membrane.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Autogenous_bone_Graft">Autogenous bone Graft</span></h5>
<p>In some situation it would be best to harvest the patients own bone either from chin or back portion of jaw.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bio_Engineered_material">Bio Engineered material</span></h5>
<p>Enhances and stimulates the cells of our own bone.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Bone_Split">Bone Split</span></h5>
<p>It is a technique where outer and inner side of jaw bone is separated so that grafting can be done in between the core of the bone and in some situation simultaneous implants placement may be possible.
