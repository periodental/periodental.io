<h4>Atraumatic Extraction</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Planning for implant placement should ideally begin before the extraction. A traumatic extraction prevents further loss of bone and tissue by using special instruments like periotomes, Piezo Electric tips etc. We utilizes these techniques on a routine basis.

<p>In a conventional removal of a broken or carious tooth involves cutting of the bone around the tooth. Preserving this bone is critical during extraction. Every bit of bone and tissue which is preserved helps in proper placement of dental implants. It is hard to regenerate the bone if it is lost in its height.
</p>
<p>Piezo Electric tips with acoustic effects of vibration loosen the teeth with in the bone without cutting away the bone.  Periotomes can be inserted in the periodontal ligament to loosen the teeth. These are some of the atraumatic techniques which are being utilized at our clinic.
