<p>When a tooth is extracted, a series of reaction takes place around the extracted site. With in 2 to 3 months the size of the bone and tissue is reduced to half of theirs original size. This process continues over a long term until the bone and tissue becomes very thin and also loses its height. The adjacent teeth tend to take the position of the missing teeth in uncontrolled ways which lead to tilting of teeth. The opposite teeth elongates as there is no antagonist tooth to hold on. Missing teeth also leads to esthetic problems, the facial support is lost, and patient finds difficulty in chewing and speech. Some patient may find joint and muscular pain due to loss of vertical support. It is therefore advisable to replace the missing teeth with artificial teeth.
