<h4>Preventing periodontal disease is better than cure</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Time, effort and money spent on prevention of dental disease is easier, and cheaper than treatment. Many people think that by the age of 60 or 65 some or all of their teeth will be lost and dentures are inevitable. Do you know your teeth are meant to last for a life time?
</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two dental diseases responsible for 90% of teeth loss. They are Periodontal disease (gum disease) and Caries.
</p>
<p>About 50% of the teeth loss is due to Periodontal disease.
</p>
<p>These single most important factor for these diseases are bacteria. When plaque which is sticky layer accumulates over teeth the bacteria grows in the plaque. For both these diseases if preventive measures are adopted in your routine there are good chances that you will not end up with the dentures or expensive implants or bridge to restore them.

<h5>Following are the preventive measures</h5>
<p>Brush using fluoride tooth paste, twice a day and if possible after every meal</p>
