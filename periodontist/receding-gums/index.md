<h4>Receding gums</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The tissue (gums) play important part in the esthetic of teeth and face. It is like a curtain which covers the roots of teeth and gives proper length to the crowns. The receded gums can make the crown appears longer and shows spaces between teeth.

<p>Periodontists (like me) are trained to perform fine plastic surgeries. There are several ways by which the lost tissue can be recovered. At Perio Dental, we use minimal invasive techniques using microscope and fine instruments. In most of the cases the gum papilla remains intact and results in a very natural looking gums and smile.
