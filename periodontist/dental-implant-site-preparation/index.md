<p>For functional and esthetically pleasing Dental Implants, there has to be near to normal bone and soft tissue. Without a good quality and quantity of these tissue the Implants may lack proper positioning, good esthetics and longevity.
</p>

<p>In many situation patients have already lost the bone. This is not surprising because the bone shrinks rapidly after the extraction. The papilla between the implant crowns and or between implant crowns and adjacent teeth is a tissue which bears great significance in esthetics. Without proper papilla, black triangular spaces are visible which are highly unaesthetic and may lead to whistling while talking. Added to this the food debris gets trapped in those area.
