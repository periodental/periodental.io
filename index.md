Every one would like to keep their natural teeth for lifelong. However, if you are suffering from silent gum disease, you may loose the teeth earlier. We can help in diagnosing the gum disease and treat the root cause of the disease. Using this approach will effectively treat the gum disease. You will benefit by having healthy teeth and gums, which can significantly extend the life of the teeth.</p>

<p>If you happen to be in a stage of advanced periodontal disease and teeth cannot be saved or you have already lost the teeth, we can provide implant supported fix or removable teeth. You can expect the final result which will look natural and pleasing and long lasting. We look at all the aspects of smile and gum tissue and based on that we make a customized treatment plan. In most of the situations you can get fixed teeth immediately after removing the teeth.</p>

<p>Valley Periodontics and Dental Implants is a specialty clinic dealing with gum diseases and esthetic and plastic surgeries of oral tissue. We also provide dental implant treatment to replace missing teeth, with special emphasis on soft tissue esthetics and maintenance around the dental implants. Our clinic is also equipped with IV Sedation Facilities.</p>

<p>Our mission is to provide comprehensive, conservative and excellent treatment procedures in keeping with the highest standard of periodontal and implant treatment and care. We are committed to using state of the art dental technology in our practice.</p>

<p>A dental implant is a wonderful, easy and conservative way to replace a missing tooth. If you are missing one or more teeth, but do not like to wear full or partial denture and would prefer to leave the adjacent teeth untouched, dental implants are excellent choice.</p>

<p>The cost of dental implants maybe more affordable than what you think. Our office will present all options. The best dental implant solution for one patient, may not be the best for another.</p>

<p>At Valley Periodontics office in Abbotsford, we try to understand what is the exact concern for each patient and come up with the best solution to meet the patientâ€™s needs.</p>
