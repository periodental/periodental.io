<p>Gum plays important part in the esthetic of teeth and face. It is like a curtain which covers the roots of teeth and gives proper length to the crowns. The receded gums (lost tissue) can make the tooth appear longer and shows spaces between teeth.</p>
<p>Gum recession is treated with gum grafts. There are various techniques and materials used with gum grafts.</p>
<p>Periodontists are trained to perform fine plastic surgeries.  At Perio Dental, we use minimal invasive techniques based on current research, using microscope and fine instruments which results in a very natural looking gums and smile.</p>

<h4>Connective tissue graft</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Tissue is taken from the roof of the mouth and grafted in deficient area. This procedure is highly predictable and provides natural looking tissue. Unlike in the past when it was a painful healing process, today with micro surgical fine instruments and sutures the wound is covered by the outer skin. This makes virtually painless healing and also leads to enhanced esthetics.
</p>

<h4>Allograft or Xenograft</h4>

<p>An alternative to using tissue from the roof of the mouth (autograft) is to use the donor tissue like acellular dermal matrix derived from humans (Allograft) or animal products (Xenograft) such as mucograft. The results of this is very close to the autograft (connective tissue)
These materials are processed with sophisticated techniques in the lab and is safe. The results of allograft is equally effective with the added advantage of avoiding second surgery on the palate.
</p>

<h4>Lateral pedicle graft</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Tissue is transplanted from adjacent site. Some times a combination of connective tissue graft or allograft and lateral pedicle graft is recommended for best results.
</p>

<h5>Bio Engineered materials</h5>
<p>The Results of grafting procedures can be further enhanced with the addition of biological engineered materials such as EMD (Emdogain) The roots and the tissue are treated with proteins, derived from developing teeth buds of animals or growth factors which can stimulate the body cells to grow in the deficient area.

<h6><i>Certified Specialist in Periodontics</i></h6>

<p>Dr. Mansur Roy is a Periodontist. He has taken extensive post graduate training in Periodontics, Dental Implants and sedation. He is also certified by the College of BC to perform intravenous conscious sedation.</p>

<p>After practicing Dentistry for several years in India, he completed his graduation in Dentistry at University of British Columbia (UBC) where he received an Award in Prosthodontics. He continued his studies in United States for three years where he received his Masters Degree in Periodontics.  His subject of research was bone and tissue grafts with bio engineered materials.</p>

<p>He is one of the founding member and past president of Implant Society in India which served continuing education to dentists.</p>

<p>Preserving and developing natural tissue esthetics in the treatment of Dental implants and Periodontics is his primary interest. He has provided seminars in the subject of Periodontics and Dental Implants to dentists.</p>

<h4>Guided Tissue Regeneration</h4>
<p></p>

<p>Periodontal science has advanced tremendously in the past 10 years. Today we can regenerate the lost tissue and bone due to periodontal disease by procedures known as Guided Tissue Regeneration.
</p>
<p>The basic principle of guided tissue regeneration is that it prevents the faster growing outer cells to migrate in the healing wound and allows the bone and functional tissue of gums to grow around the roots.
</p>
<p>Guided tissue regeneration utilizes collagen membrane derived from animals and bone materials derived from animals or human cadavers. It also utilizes recently developed bio-engineered materials like enamel protein derivatives and platelet derived growth factors. These materials stimulate the growth of our body cells in the right proportion.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, with any periodontal surgeries there used to be big gaps at the base of teeth which was a huge maintenance problems as well as esthetic disfigurement for many patients.  With the newer surgical techniques provided at Perio Dental, like modified papilla regeneration and specialized suturing techniques, you can expect minimal loss of your gingival tissue.
</p>
<p>At Perio Dental, we utilize micro surgical techniques to perform these procedures.

<h4>Muco Gingival problems</h4>
<p></p>

<p>The tissue at the margin of gums is generally firmly attached and pink in color. This tissue is known as keratinized gingiva. The keratinized gingiva protects the integrity of the gingiva and resist recession and inflammation.
</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of keratinized tissue the thickness of gum is also minimal. Combined with these two factors the gum can not resist brushing pressure or chewing of abrasive food. These problems are known as muco gingival problems. In some situation, the available height of tissue from the junction of cheek and gum margin is less and the patients may find difficulty in brushing or maintaining the gingival health.
</p>
<p>All these problems can be corrected with periodontal plastic surgery at Valley Periodontics and Dental Implants, where we utilize techniques like grafts, flap surgeries, etc.
